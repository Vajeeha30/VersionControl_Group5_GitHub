Introduction

Version control systems help people work together on the same project without messing up each other’s work. They keep a record of all changes and make it easy to fix mistakes or go back to an earlier version if needed.

Websites like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket let teams store their projects online so everyone can work from different places. These tools allow us to create branches, make changes, and later combine those changes with the main project.

In this task, I am working as a collaborator. I will create my own branch, add changes like introduction, details, and conclusion, and then upload my work to the repository. This helps me learn how to use branching, committing, and teamwork in a shared project
