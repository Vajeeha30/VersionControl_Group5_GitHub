Introduction:
              Version control systems help people work together on the same project without messing up each other’s work. They keep a record of all changes and make it easy to fix mistakes or go back to an earlier version if needed.

Websites like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket let teams store their projects online so everyone can work from different places. These tools allow us to create branches, make changes, and later combine those changes with the main project.

In this task, I am working as a collaborator. I will create my own branch, add changes like introduction, details, and conclusion, and then upload my work to the repository. This helps me learn how to use branching, committing, and teamwork in a shared project

Details:
          After creating my own branch from the main branch, I started working on the document. First, I reviewed the purpose of the selected version control platform and noted its important features.

I then made updates to the file by adding helpful information. These changes were saved using commits. Each commit showed what I changed, making it easier to understand my progress.

While working, I made sure my updates did not affect the main branch directly. All my work stayed inside my branch until it was ready to be reviewed. This helps avoid mistakes and keeps the main project safe.

Through this process, I learned how branches allow team members to work on different tasks at the same time without disturbing each other’s work.

Conclusion:
            Working as a collaborator helped me understand how version control makes teamwork easier. By creating my own branch, I was able to make changes without affecting the main project. Committing my work showed a clear record of every update I made.

This process taught me how important branching is when many people are working together. It also helped me learn the basic steps of updating files, saving changes, and preparing them for merging. Overall, this activity improved my confidence in using version control tools for real projects.
