Title: GitHub — Version Control Platform
Introduction

GitHub is a web-based version control platform that allows developers and teams to manage their projects and collaborate efficiently.
It uses Git as its underlying system, which helps in tracking every change made to the project files.
Through GitHub, multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
It keeps a complete history of changes and allows teams to restore previous versions if needed.
GitHub also supports teamwork by providing tools for reviewing changes, discussing ideas, and managing project progress.
