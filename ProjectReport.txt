Title: GitHub — Version Control Platform
Introduction 
GitHub is a widely used online platform that supports version control and team-based software development. It is built on the Git system, which helps developers record changes, maintain project history, and work on code collaboratively.By using GitHub, several developers can contribute to the same project at the same time without overwriting each other’s updates.

Details:
GitHub allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories.
It supports branching, letting users work on different features without affecting the main project.
Pull requests are used to review and merge code changes safely.
Built-in tools like issues and project boards help in tracking bugs and managing tasks.
It also integrates with CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment.

Conclusion:
GitHub is a powerful and user-friendly platform that simplifies teamwork in software development.
It helps developers collaborate, track changes, and manage projects efficiently through features like branches and pull requests.
Overall, GitHub enhances productivity and ensures smooth version control in both small and large projects.
